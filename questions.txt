a)
For the purpose of showing sales figures, returns, and cancellations, 
I suggest using a tabular report style. 
For users who need to quickly examine data across product categories and time periods, 
this format is easy to understand, brief, and consume.

Product Category: The category of the products sold.
Sales Numbers: The total number of sales for each product category in the last week and last month.
Returns: The total number of returns for each product category in the last week and last month.
Cancellations: The total number of cancellations for each product category in the last week and last month.

b)
q1-  In what ways do you divide up your products into different categories? 
    Is there a set system of classification you use, or should we create categories 
    based on the characteristics of the products?

q2-  Are aggregated totals adequate, 
    or would you need a breakdown of sales, refunds, and cancellations by specific products 
    within each product category in the report? Are there other relevant data points you want to include, 
    like average sales price or percentage of returns/cancellations per category?

q3-  How often do you need this report generated (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly)?

q4-  Do you need the ability to sort or filter the data based on specific criteria, 
    such as highest sales or most returns?

q5- Who will be using this report (e.g., managers, analysts, executives, business units)?

This prioritization considers both effort and business impact, aiming for optimal value delivery.
High business impact heavily influences priority.

No	Req.	    Effort	Business Impact (S/M/L/XL)	Priority(1-6)
1	Backlog 1	45	    M	                        6
2	Backlog 2	15	    XL                          2
3	Backlog 3	3	    S	                        4
4	Backlog 4	5	    XL	                        1
5	Backlog 5	40	    S	                        5
6	Backlog 6	10	    L                           3	


*Priority of Backlog 4 is 1. Because it is the top priority due to its strong business impact, 
even with little effort. Taking care of urgent requirements first maximizes value.

*Similar to Backlog 4, Backlog 2's high business impact outweighs slightly higher effort, 
making it crucial to address early.

*From the Same Approach I decided the priority of Backlog 6 is 3. 
Despite the moderate effort required, the lesser business impact indicates that 
it may be handled effectively without impeding other important tasks.

*Priority value of Backlog 3 is assigned as 4. 
Its low effort and positive business impact make it a good candidate 
for quick wins that can boost progress



3- 

1-  Firstly, I ask the user for the report link to verify if the data is up-to-date. 
    I check the validity of the report through this link.

2-  Check for any error messages or warnings related to data processing or report generation.

3-  I review the dataset to understand its structure, 
    including the columns, data types, and any relevant metadata. And compare the dataset to historical data 
    to identify any anomalies.

4-  I examine the query or process used to generate the dataset to ensure 
    there are no errors or discrepancies in the data extraction or transformation process.

5-  Map the data journey from source to report generation, identifying all transformation steps.
    And I attempt to replicate the error using the same data and processing steps.
